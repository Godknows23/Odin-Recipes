    <h1><img src="Images/chicken AI Pastor.jpg" alt="image" /> Chicken AI Pastor </h1>
    <p>This chicken al pastor features almost-charred pineapple and toasty spicy chicken that is incredibly tender and juicy! 
      Serve with of white onion and fresh cilantro.</p>
      <P>Although the cooking style is identical to that of the Lebanese shawarma with its vertical spit-roasting method, the meat is completely different from lamb.
         Pork shoulder is slow-cooked to keep its tenderness while it is thinly sliced off the spinning spit-roa</P>
         <h><b> Ingredients</b></h>
         <ul>
            <li> 4 dried guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded </ul>
            <li> 1 ⅓ cups finely chopped onion, divided</li>
            <li> ⅔ cup orange juice</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons achiote paste</li>
            <li> 6 large cloves garlic, peeled</li>
            <li> 1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, drained</li>
        </ul>
        <h>Steps</h>
        <ol>
              <li> Heat a skillet over medium-high heat.
                 Add dried chiles; cook, turning occasionally, until toasted and blistered in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. Add 1 cup water to just cover the chiles, and bring to a simmer over medium-high. Cover and cook, undisturbed, until softened, about 5 minutes. Drain well.  </li>
              <li> Combine chiles, achiote, garlic, chipotles, 2/3 cup onion, orange juice, vinegar, oil, cumin, brown sugar, and salt in a blender; process until smooth, about 30 seconds. Reserve 1/2 cup marinade, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.           </li>
              <li> Place remaining marinade in a shallow dish or large resealable plastic bag, add chicken; toss to evenly coat. Cover chicken with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours. Place wooden skewers in a shallow dish; cover with water by 1 inch. Let stand at room temperature while chicken marinates.
              </li>
              <li> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Position oven rack 8 inches away from heating element. Line a small roasting pan or 13- x 9-inch baking dish with aluminum foil.
              </li>              
        </ol>
